## 👋 About Me

I'm a Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo with a strong interest in **quantitative research, data science, and machine learning applied to real-world decision making**.

I enjoy working at the intersection of:
- **Probability & statistics**
- **Time-series analysis**
- **Simulation & empirical research**
- **Interpretable machine learning**

I focus on building systems that **answer real questions**, not just models that look good on paper.

## 🚀 Projects

### 📈 Stochastic Simulation for Index Futures
*Python, NumPy, pandas*

- Built a **domain-specific query language** to express stochastic simulation intent over financial time series
- Ran **10,000+ Monte Carlo simulations per query** using bootstrap sampling
- Detected **p-hacked strategies with 68% accuracy**, preventing ~$2,000 in paper-trading losses
- Ranked technical indicators using correlation and \(R^2\) for signal selection

---

### 🎧 Music Listener Engagement Analysis
*Python, scikit-learn, SQLite*

- Modeled listener engagement using **Hidden Markov Models**
- Identified skip-prone segments accounting for **21.3% of track duration**
- Built probabilistic state inference using **Multinomial Logistic Regression**
- Designed a **normalized relational database** for per-second engagement analytics

---

### 🏀 NBA Fantasy Performance Predictor
*Python, XGBoost, FastAPI, React*

- Processed **5,000+ rows** of NBA performance data
- Built ML pipelines with **XGBoost** (performance prediction) and **KNN** (player similarity)
- Improved lineup decisions by **30% over rolling windows**
- Deployed a **FastAPI backend** with a React/TypeScript frontend
